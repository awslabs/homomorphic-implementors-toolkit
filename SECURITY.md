## Security of CKKS Homomorphic Encryption

AWS recommends against using HIT in production environments until a provably secure alternative to the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme is available. A recent work by [Li and Micciancio](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1533) has demonstrated that CKKS is only secure in certain use cases within an honest-but-curious adversarial model. Previously, it was believed that the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme was secure in that model. Specifically, the authors give a concrete, efficient algorithm to recover the CKKS decryption key given a small number of pairs of the form (c, Decrypt_k(c)). At this time, there is no provably secure alternative to CKKS, so the only way to ensure the security of an application using CKKS is to restrict visibility into the decrypted values to those with access to the decryption key.
